        <h2>Benefits of Homeopathy</h2>  
            This is our last hope!” In all her years of experience, Sonam has often heard this as a parting remark from a parent as they are leaving after their initial consultation. People decide to try homeopathy for anything from chronic skin eruptions, to more complex, deep-seated conditions that Western medicine has been unable to help them with.
            In general, health problems are triggered by an individual’s inability to withstand stress, which in turn leads to a specific weakness in their immune system. This is then expressed by “dis-ease”. The homeopath’s task is to match a person and their condition to an appropriate, individually selected homeopathic remedy. Homeopathic remedies have the ability to spark our innate capacity for healing ourselves. Another great benefit of homeopathic treatment is that it is gentle and does not have any side-effects.
